    Great things happen when developers work togetherâ€”from teaching and sharing knowledge to building better software. Teletype for Atom makes collaborating on code just
    as easy as it is to code alone, right from your editor.
    Share your workspace and edit code together in real time. To start collaborating, open Teletype in Atom and install the package.
